# Predicting-Heart-Disease

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease based on a dataset of patient health metrics. The project is part of the MGMT 273 Machine Learning course.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify the presence or absence of heart disease in patients using various health indicators. The dataset used for this project is heart.csv, which includes features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## Features
Data Exploration: Initial analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Model Training: Building and evaluating machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

## How to Use
### 1. Clone the repository:
